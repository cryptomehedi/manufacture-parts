            <h3 className='text-2xl font-bold'>Founded from two great companies in warehousing and logistics</h3>
            <p className='my-3'>Manufacturing Parts Anywhere is the outcome of a merger between Life Storage's Corporate Alliance division and Intelligent Logistic Solutions (ILS). Independently, both companies are leaders in technology, developing systems to better manage their clients and services. Life Storage's Corporate Alliance program services national accounts with a need for multiple storage units in multiple cities. ILS has propriety inventory tracking systems and software that simplify inventory tracking and monitoring for its customer base.</p>
            <p>In 2016, Life Storage purchased the assets of ILS, and merged it with its Corporate Alliance division. Today, Manufacturing Parts Anywhere serves its customers with storage management and inventory management at scale. This unique combination allows businesses to change the way they think about warehousing and distribution - they are now able to forward deploy products in the markets they do business, while improving inventory tracking accuracy and reducing logistics costs.</p>
            <p className='my-3'>Founded in 1982, Life Storage is a publicly held Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) traded on the New York Stock Exchange as LSI. The company operates over 950 storage facilities encompassing more than 50 million square feet, and serving over 400,000 customers. Manufacturing Parts Anywhere maintains a network of 12,000 storage facilities at which it manages space rental for large commercial clients.</p>
